# Quality for Biters!

Quality for Biters! adds quality scaling to enemy units based on the current evolution factor.

As evolution increases, higher-quality enemies gradually begin to appear.
The impact is minimal in the early game and becomes more pronounced toward the late game.

## Affected targets
- Nauvis:
  - All enemy units
  - Biter spawners
  - Spitter spawners
- Gleba:
  - All enemy units
  - Gleba spawners

## Design intent
This mod is not intended to drastically change early-game balance.
Instead, it increases long-term pressure by making late-game enemies tougher and more varied.

On higher difficulty presets (Death World / Marathon),
defense planning and maintenance become significantly more important.

## Dependencies
- Manis_lib
- Quality mod (required)

## Documentation
- Design decisions and guarantees are documented in `spec.md`.
